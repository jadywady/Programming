Hello! This is Jade, Wong Zi Ling (001124979, mrqk68).
This website is based off on my favourite video game, Genshin Impact. 
It will introduce the basics of Teyvat and its seven regions, characters and archons.
Very geeky, I know. 


-------how to open
open with live preview (extension in vscode) or else the json doc will not work!
open index.html and done!

-------description of every section:
1. paralax effect header
this was done firstly in photoshop, where i seperated an image into three layers, then overlap them.
javascript was used to make them move in different speed as the user scrolls.

2. teyvat intro
just a short introduction of teyvat with angled div made from css.

3. map of teyvat
used a high quality image of the in-game map and with the leaflet module, a simple map with markers was made.
Nevermind, I tried submitting it but the file was way too big so I linked the online image instead. 

4. elements introduction
a flexbox of elements and a glow version of each which can only be seen when hovered. While hovered, a description will be shown in the box below.

5. in-dept archon description
original video only starts playing when in view, loads new vid and description according to button pressed.

6. Archon overview
used css grids. when hover, it will take more of the grid, looks cool, learnt it from youtube.

7. json all characters
genshin has over 70 characters, their names, element and region are in a seperate json file which the user can see through the table. a dropdown menu allows user to chose to see which regions of characters they want to see.



Thank you for going through my website! It took so long and i restarted many times but it was fun hehe
I hope you liked it.
